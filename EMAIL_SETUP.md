# Email System Setup Guide

## Overview
The CNS Events website now uses an external API endpoint for form submissions instead of direct SMTP. This approach is more secure and reliable.

## Current Configuration

### Contact Form
- **Endpoint**: `https://bixid.in/form-response`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: application/json

### Data Format
The form sends the following data structure:
```json
{
  "Subject": "New Event Inquiry from [Customer Name]",
  "message": "Event description/details",
  "name": "Customer Name",
  "phone": "Mobile Number",
  "event_date": "Event Date",
  "guests": "Number of Guests",
  "Website": "CNS Events",
  "recipient_email": "support@cnsevent.in"
}
```

### Newsletter Subscription
- **Endpoint**: Same as contact form
- **Data Format**: Similar structure with newsletter-specific subject

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Update API Endpoint
Replace `https://bixid.in/form-response` in `src/utils/emailService.js` with your actual API endpoint.

### 2. API Response Format
Your API should return a response in this format:
```json
{
  "Status": "Success",
  "message": "Optional message"
}
```

### 3. Test the Connection
Use the "Test API Connection" button in the contact form to verify your API endpoint is working.

- Form processing endpoints
- Error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Form Not Submitting
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint URL is correct
3. Test API connection using the test button
4. Check if your API endpoint is accessible

2. Check API endpoint configuration
3. Verify form validation is passing

## Security Notes
- API keys and sensitive data should be stored securely
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
